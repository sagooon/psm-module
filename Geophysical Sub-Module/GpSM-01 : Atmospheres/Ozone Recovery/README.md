### Ozone Recovery

NASA scientists predict that the ozone hole will be smaller than 8 million square miles by 2040, marking the end of the era of big ozone holes. The ozone hole, formed by ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere, has remained larger than 8 million square miles since the early 1990s. 

The size of the ozone hole varies due to temperature and atmospheric levels of ozone-depleting chemicals. NASA's AURA satellite was used to determine the annual variation in these chemicals' levels. With this new information, scientists can confidently say that the ozone hole will be consistently smaller than 8 million square miles by 2040. They plan to continue using satellites to monitor the ozone hole's recovery and hope to see its full recovery before the end of the century.
